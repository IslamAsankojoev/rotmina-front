    "content": "Pleased to meet you. I'm Rotmina — my childhood nickname that stayed with me. \n\nI'm a fashion designer and personal stylist. \nAfter many years, I chose to dive into my true self — my authentic nature — opening up to my inner path and returning home to my core essence. \n\nThe path I walk weaves together many worlds: emotion and creative expression, a deep connection to nature and art. A decade ago, I chose veganism as a way of life. The transition felt natural and deeply aligned. Through my personal journey, I've chosen to see what — and who — often goes unseen. \n\nCarrying these insights forward, my movement through the world aims to embody an honest presence and a deep commitment to sustainability in all its layers. I strive for transparency and embrace the complexity and multidimensionality of our existence. \n\n\nEmerging from this space, Rotmina is more than a fashion brand — it's a language, an energetic resonance, a path of consciousness shaped by unity, and an ever-burning desire for depth and aesthetics. \n\nI encourage you to embrace yourself with confidence — to choose a wholeness that radiates both within and without — and to join me on this journey."

In the world of developmental\npsychology, the separation phase refers to the stage when a\nchild begins to realize that they are not a direct extension\nof their mother. They have their own emotions, sensations,\nand desires.\n\nIt's a profound, healthy, delicate, and necessary phase, at\ntimes unsteady, moving between closeness and detachment,\nsafety and vulnerability, between the need for a bond and\nthe longing for autonomy.\n\nThis journey found its course through fabric, silhouettes,\nand lines, into structures that hold the tension between\nsoftness and resilience, expansion and containment, shapes\nthat support the body while allowing it to breathe, like the\nsoul, yearning for boundaries, but not confinement, just\nperfectly whole.\n\nThis collection tells a story of connected separation, an\ninner voice seeking to become."

Killing techniques include suffocation, electrocution, neck-breaking, or gas chambers. Often, the animals do not lose consciousness immediately, resulting in prolonged and intense suffering.",
    "silkBoiling": "Boiling Silkworms Alive to Extract Intact Silk Fibers:",
    "silkBoilingDesc": "Silkworms are bred in massive quantities, after spinning their cocoons, the cocoons are placed in boiling water while the larvae are still alive, This process is intended to make it easier to unravel the silk threads in one continuous strand, As a result, billions of silkworms are killed each year in a painful process for the sake of textile production.",
    "featherPlucking": "Live Plucking of Feathers from Birds:",
    "featherPluckingDesc": "Mostly targeting geese and ducks, this practice often carried out while the animals are still alive is well documented in the fashion and textile industries. It causes injuries, infections, pain, and intense suffering. The birds are restrained while their feathers are violently torn out to maximize yield of soft down feathers, in some cases, the plucking is repeated multiple times throughout the animal's life.",
    "exoticLeather": "Farming Crocodiles, Snakes, and Lizards for Exotic Leathers:",
    "exoticLeatherDesc": "Millions of reptiles are kept in overcrowded, enclosed pools under artificial conditions that severely violate their basic needs. These environments cause extreme stress and abnormal behaviors. The slaughter process involves brutal methods such as shooting in the head or neck, stabbing the spine, or electrocution. In some documented cases, animals remain partially conscious during skinning, all for the sake of producing \"luxury fashion items\". This process inflicts extreme suffering, pain, and unnecessary death.",
    "animalWelfareGoal": "My goal is to create a safe, respectful space - one that causes no harm, suffering, or the slaughter of sentient animals for personal gain. Transitioning to alternative, animal-free materials helps reduce harm, supports the welfare of animals worldwide and contributes to elevate the collective frequency of planet Earth through conscious compassionate choices.",

    "co2Reduction": "CO2 Emission Reduction",
    "co2ReductionDesc": ": Every ton of recycled paper produced helps reduce around 2.5 tons of CO2 emissions.",
    "naturalResources": "Preservation of Natural Resources:",
    "naturalResourcesDesc": " Using recycled paper supports forest conservation and reduces the need for cutting down new trees.",
    "wasteReduction": "Waste Reduction and Reuse:",
    "wasteReductionDesc": " By using recycled packaging, we give existing materials a second life, avoiding additional production that consumes further resources. This in turn, reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and lessens the harmful emissions impacting our environment.",
    "packagingCommitment": "Rotmina will continue to be attentive to the needs of the environment and remain committed to constantly improving its practices to prevent environmental harm.
